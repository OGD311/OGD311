### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Oli, an aspiring CompSci student interested in Encryption, Computer Vision, Game Development and Machine Learning.
- I know Python, C# (Unity) and some C, C++, Rust, Java and JavaScript.
- Currently I'm working on [Lands And Legacy](https://github.com/OGD311/LandsAndLegacy) which you can check out [here](https://ogd311.github.io/SuspiciousBananaStudios.github.io/index.html) and learning more advanced C#
- I also like to make lots of small webapps, my latest is [Free URL Shortener](https://ogd311.pythonanywhere.com/)
- Feel free to contact me on Github :)
